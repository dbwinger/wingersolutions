# Refund & Cancellation Policy

## Cancellations
- Either party may cancel before work starts with no cost.
- After work has started, cancellations should be communicated in writing. Work performed and committed costs up to the cancellation date remain payable.

## Refunds
- For time-and-materials work, time already delivered is non-refundable.
- For fixed-price engagements, refunds are not provided for completed milestones. Undelivered milestones are not invoiced.

## Rescheduling
Meetings can be rescheduled with reasonable notice. Repeated short-notice cancellations may incur billed time for prepared work.

## Quality Issues
If a deliverable has material defects, we will remedy them within a reasonable timeframe aligned to the agreed scope. Remedies do not include feature changes or new scope.
