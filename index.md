# Ruby on Rails Development & Consulting

## Hi, I'm Daryl Winger ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Ruby on Rails specialist** with 20+ years of experience building web applications that work. Recently relocated from the US to the Netherlands, I help businesses and individuals turn their ideas, big and small, into robust, scalable software solutions.

### How We'll Work Together

I believe great software comes from great partnerships. When we work together, you can expect:

- **Clear Communication** - Regular updates and honest feedback throughout the project
- **Collaborative Approach** - Your input and vision combined with my software dev experience guide every decision.
- **Quality Code** - Clean, performant, and maintainable solutions that last
- **Lasting Results** - Software that grows with your business and stands the test of time

My goal isn't just to write codeâ€”it's to understand your business and build something that truly serves your needs.

### ðŸš€ **Ready to Ship**
- **Custom Web Applications** - From MVP to enterprise-scale
- **API Development** - RESTful services and integrations  
- **Legacy Modernization** - Upgrade your Rails apps to the latest versions
- **Performance Optimization** - Make your existing apps faster

### ðŸ’¡ **Why Choose Ruby on Rails?**

Rails lets us build powerful web applications **fast**. It's battle-tested by companies like GitHub, Shopify, and Basecamp. With Rails, you get:

- **Rapid Development** - Get to market faster
- **Scalable Architecture** - Grows with your business
- **Rich Ecosystem** - Thousands of developers and many solutions already provided through gems
- **Active Community** - Continuous improvements and support

<!-- ### ðŸ“ˆ **Recent Work**
