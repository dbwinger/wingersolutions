## Services
We provide software development, consulting, and related services as agreed in writing (email or signed proposal). Work begins after written confirmation and, if requested, an upfront payment or purchase order.

## Contract precedence
These website terms are informational for inquiries. If there is any conflict between these terms and a signed agreement, the signed agreement prevails.

- Fixed-price contracts may be offered for well-defined scopes.
- Invoices are payable within 14 days of the invoice date unless otherwise agreed.

Changes to scope, timeline, or assumptions may adjust fees and delivery dates. Additional work is billed at the agreed hourly rate unless a new fixed price is confirmed in writing.

## Intellectual Property
Upon full payment, the client receives the agreed license or ownership as specified in the proposal; third-party components remain under their respective licenses.

Services are provided "as-is" without express warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or non-infringement. We make no guarantees of specific business outcomes or error-free code.

## Force Majeure
Neither party is liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond reasonable control (natural disasters, war, pandemic, government action, etc.). The affected party will notify the other and resume performance when possible.

## Confidentiality
Both parties will keep confidential information private and use it only for the engagement.

## Liability
Liability is limited to the amount paid for the services in the 3 months preceding the event, and in any case capped at €25,000. We are not liable for indirect or consequential damages.
