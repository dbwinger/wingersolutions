# Delivery Policy

## Services Delivery
- Work is delivered iteratively (e.g., milestones, sprints) with regular demos and check-ins.
- Deliverables (code, documentation, deployments) are provided via agreed repositories or infrastructure.

## Timelines
Timelines are estimates and depend on scope, client input, and third-party dependencies. Material changes to scope or assumptions may require timeline adjustments.

## Client Responsibilities
Timely feedback, access to systems, and provision of necessary materials are required to keep delivery on schedule.

## Acceptance
A deliverable is accepted when it meets the agreed specifications or after 10 business days without written rejection identifying material issues.

## Changes
Change requests may affect delivery dates and fees. Approved changes are confirmed in writing (email is sufficient).
